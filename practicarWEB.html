                In order to unlock the Fortnite Dark Voyager skin, you'll first have to purchase the Fortnite season 3 Battle Pass. This will set you back 950 V-Bucks (you can purchase 1,000 for $9.99), which will grant you the ability to unlock new tiers of rewards the more you play.
After unlocking the season 3 Battle Pass, you will have access to 100 tiers of goodies (an increase over season 2's 70). These tiers are unlocked the more you play, with Epic Games estimating that it will take players between 70 - 150 hours to unlock everything. Each tier has its own specific reward(s), with the higher tears boasting the most desirable rewards.
The Dark Voyager skin, which is part of the Space Explorers set, is locked behind tier 70. This means that it'll take a considerable amount of grinding to reach it unless players fork over some cash.
